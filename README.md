# Amanda's React Boilerplate
Created a simple template for getting React projects using Babel, Webpack, and Airbnb Style Guide. This way, I don't need to rewrite the exact same config files everytime I want to build a new React project. 

## Getting Started

run npm install
npm run
npm compile

## Versioning

* "react": "^16.4.0",
* "react-dom": "^16.4.0"
* "webpack": "^4.11.1",
* "webpack-cli": "^3.0.3"
